# FLStudioOxygenPro49
FL Studio 20 script for the M-Audio Oxygen Pro 49 controller.

Note: I have no previous experience with MIDI controllers so this might be a bit different from other integrations, but I intend this script to work well for at least my personal case. ;-)

The M-Audio Oxygen Pro 49 seems to provide four MIDI input devices.  
According to some tests I made:
- Normal keys/notes can be received via device 1 
- I have no idea what device 2 is for, yet
- Device 3 handles most of the sliders, knobs and buttons when the controller is set to DAW mode
- Device 4 I'm unsure about, but it seems like the M-Audio editor uses that one to transfer presets from and to the controller (?)
